4.1 QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
### 1. What patterns do you observe in the training and validation accuracy curves?  
    Training and validation accuracy curves show how well a model is learning over time.
    Training accuracy usually increases over time as the model learns the patterns in the data.
    Validation accuracy may also improve initially but can start to fluctuate or decrease if the model overfits. 
    If training accuracy is much higher than validation accuracy, it indicates overfitting.
    If both training and validation accuracy increase together, the model is learning well.
    A small gap between them suggests good generalization.


### 2. How can you use TensorBoard to detect overfitting?  

    TensorBoard provides visualization tools to track both training and validation loss. 
    If training loss keeps decreasing while validation loss starts increasing, it means the model is overfitting. 
    You can also check accuracy plotsâ€”if validation accuracy stagnates or drops while training accuracy rises, overfitting is happening. 
    Comparing different training runs in TensorBoard helps in choosing better hyperparameters and regularization techniques.


### 3. What happens when you increase the number of epochs?  
    An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset by the model.
    Increasing the number of epochs allows the model to learn more patterns in the training data. 
    It helps the model learn better, improving both training and validation accuracy.
    Initially, both training and validation accuracy may improve, but after a certain point, the model may start overfitting.
    This leading to poor generalization on unseen data. 
    If the validation accuracy stops improving or decreases while training accuracy remains high, it suggests overfitting. 
    Proper tuning of the number of epochs, along with techniques like dropout or batch normalization, can help balance learning and generalization.
